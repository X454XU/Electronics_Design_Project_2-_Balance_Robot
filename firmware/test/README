This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

1. This folder contains ArduinoIDE file to easily observe the gyro and acceleration

upload mpu6050.h onto arduino point use .ino file to view it 

choose band as 115200 in arduino IDE serial monitor before uploading the mpu6050.h

2. There is also a plot.py which is used for datavisualization, change the serial_port according to your computer

DO NOT use platform IO to uploading the main.cpp and running this visualisation script at the same time. Port conflicts can occur if you do so. after Pulling this from GitHub, simply run "python plot.py" (you need to change serial_port first), Ctrl+C to interrupt it when you think you have enough data, then the data can be found in output.csv
